# GitHubSearch
***Samuel Durfey, Epicodus, JavaScript Week 1***

#### Search GitHub by a user's login, and see a list of their repositories
(or at least the first 30 of them)

Enter a user's login, and click the button to see these features:
- Username
- The user's real name
- The user's avatar image
- A list of the first 30 repositories listed under that user
- You can also click on the followers doohickey to see a list of who follows them
****

**Note: currently does not work if you don't have a GitHub api key. Working on making version that will work without one.**

- Create a file in the root directory called .env 
- enter this code, and save the document:


`exports.apiKey = "insert_your_own_personal_api_key_here";`

*This project now has a GitHub page! Go here:*
